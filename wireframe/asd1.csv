There are red, white and green painted markers all the way up to the monastery, and various forks in the path you can take. I would recommend following the Cami de les Aigues (GR 5) trail, it veers slightly to the left and is the easiest option. It takes you 10 minutes longer to get to the top and ascends less quickly, but has a wider and easier path.
